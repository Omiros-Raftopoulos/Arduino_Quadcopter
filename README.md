Aim of this project is the design and implementation of an
Quadcopter with the ability of remote control by the user.

Management of the Quadcopter's functions will be carried through the Arduino
microprocessor in interaction with other integrated systems such as a
gyroscope, an accelerometer, a Bluetooth adapter, ESC speed controllers etc.

The functions that can be performed include among others driven flight, static
equilibrium and compensation. Control by the user will be performed through
an application developed for the Android operating system.
